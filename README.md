### Personal Rules

* Write everything (variable names, commit messages etc.) in English
* Comment regularly
* Always write clear and proper commit messages
* Make atomic commits - try to limit the number of files that are updated in each commit
* Only commit "clean" code
* Try to do unit tests as often as possible
* Review other members' contributions if the code that they have written is of vital importance
